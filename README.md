# üß™ TDD & BDD Practice Project

This project is a hands-on practice repository for exploring **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** and **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** concepts using Python, `unittest`, and `behave`.

It is based on coursework from IBM's *Introduction to BDD* course on Coursera and has been extended and modified for personal exploration and deeper understanding.

## üìö What‚Äôs Included

- `calculator.py` ‚Äì Core logic for basic calculator operations
- `test_calculator.py` ‚Äì Unit tests using Python‚Äôs `unittest` framework
- `features/` ‚Äì BDD scenarios using `behave`, including:
  - `.feature` files for behavior specifications
  - Step definitions for linking behavior to Python code
- Example workflows for:
  - Test-Driven Development (TDD)
  - Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dahomyarii/tdd-bdd-practice.git
cd tdd-bdd-practice
```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> If `requirements.txt` is not provided, manually install:
> ```bash
> pip install behave
> ```

4. **Run Unit Tests**

```bash
python -m unittest test_calculator.py
```

5. **Run BDD Tests**

```bash
behave
```

## üéì Learning Goals

This project helped reinforce:

- Writing unit tests before code (TDD)
- Using BDD with Gherkin syntax (`Given`, `When`, `Then`)
- Understanding the role of test automation in agile workflows
- Practicing clean, testable Python code
